# Wind turbine design

Wind turbine design is the process of defining the form and configuration of a wind turbine to extract energy from the wind. An installation consists of the systems needed to capture the wind's energy, point the turbine into the wind, convert mechanical rotation into electrical power, and other systems to start, stop, and control the turbine.

**Betz Law**
In 1919, German physicist [Albert Betz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Betz) showed that for a hypothetical ideal wind-energy extraction machine, the fundamental laws of conservation of mass and energy allowed no more than 16/27 (59.3%) of the wind's kinetic energy to be captured. This Betz' law limit can be approached by modern turbine designs which reach 70 to 80% of this theoretical limit.

The speed at which the turbine first starts to rotate and generate power is called the `cut-in speed` and is typically between `3 and 4 meters per second`

However, typically somewhere between `12 and 17 meters per second`, the power output reaches the limit that the electrical generator is capable of. This limit to the generator output is called the `rated power output` and the wind speed at which it is reached is called the `rated output wind speed`.

As the speed increases above the `rated output wind speed`, the forces on the turbine structure continue to rise and, at some point, there is a risk of damage to the rotor. As a result, a braking system is employed to bring the rotor to a standstill. This is called the `cut-out speed` and is usually around `25 meters per second`.

**Wind turbine efficiency or power coefficient**

The available power in a stream of wind of the same cross-sectional area as the wind turbine can easily be shown to be:

Where

U - wind speed is in m/s
p - density in kilograms per cubic meter
d - diameter in meters
and available power is in watts.

The efficiency, Î¼, or, as it is more commonly called, the power coefficient, cp, of the wind turbine is simply defined as the actual power delivered divided by the available power.
